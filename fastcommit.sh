## commits changes with commit per spell
## it uses the first comment in HISTORY file for main commit msg
## others are added in detailed description
##
## ATM it only works with changes in spell paths section/spell/
## more is on todo list.
##
## TODO
## - improve multiline commits
## - get better check  to exclude changes in section in first loop
##   there are spells == section :(
## - move the code that could be used in both loops to functions
## - handle changes that aren't spell changes but the change is
##   is described in ChangeLog
##   * this could be a second for loop. changes could be obtained with:
##     git diff --numstat |sed -e "s/[0-9]*[\t]*[0-9]*[\t]*//"
##   * search in ChangeLog to get the right msg would be needed!
##   * also problematic would be the commit of changelog... since
##     it would be to commit per line.. For single change it would go...
