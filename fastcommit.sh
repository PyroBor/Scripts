## commits changes with commit per spell
## it uses the first comment in HISTORY file for main commit msg
## others are added in detailed description
##
## ATM it only works with changes in spell paths section/spell/
## more is on todo list.
##
## TODO
## - improve multiline commits
## - move the code that could be used in both loops to functions
## - handle changes that aren't spell changes but the change is
##   is described in ChangeLog
##   * search in ChangeLog to get the right msg would be needed!
##   * also problematic would be the commit of changelog... since
##     it would be to commit per line.. For single change it would go...
##   * atm we avoid this by only applying if there 2 files changed
##     ChangeLog + one changed
## - handle new spells :) that one is even harder... it only has ChangeLog.
##   but in ChangeLog there is path that could be used...
##   perhaps one loop before file commit loop. but same problem:
##   * also problematic would be the commit of changelog... since
##     it would be to commit per line..
